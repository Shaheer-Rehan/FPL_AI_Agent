I started playing Fantasy Premier League (FPL) in 2016, after my best friend introduced me to the game. 9 years on, I'm teaming up with that same friend [@HussainAhmed10](https://github.com/HussainAhmed10) to build an AI Agent that will play the game we have been so passionate about for years.

This blog documents our journey building an AI-powered FPL agent, designed to learn and improve by simulating game scenarios rather than relying solely on historical human player data.  

Expect project updates, performance tracking, and technical deep dives.
