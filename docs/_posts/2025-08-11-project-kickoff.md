title: "Cheating at FPL using AI Agents - Kickoff"

The referee blows the whistle, and the game begins!

Today marks the start of my journey into building an AI-powered Fantasy Premier League Agent. My strike partner for this match (Yes, I'm continuing with the metaphor,) is the ever-reliable [@HussainAhmed10](https://github.com/HussainAhmed10). Together, we hope to write the next important chapter in Fantasy Premier League by introducing Agentic AI to the beautiful game. But hey, if we can't change the game or ruffle a few feathers, at least we'll have some fun along the way. 

Over the coming months, we'll share progress updates, challenges, and results of our FPL AI Agent. Let's see where cheating gets us!
